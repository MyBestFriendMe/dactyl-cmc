 dactyl build to best emulate an advantage360

# What is this?
 I used the configurator at [ryanis.cool/cosmos](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/) to create my best attempt at an Advantage360 clone.
 I used a multitude of great resources out there on how to wire and program my own keyboards but
 if you would like to see a build tutorial on this exact keyboard then I will try to make time to
 get all of the details recorded on this repo.
