# Dactyl-CMC
 I made a Dactyl build based on my Advantage360 that I had at work and couldn't afford to buy a second one for my home office at
 the time. So I did the only logical thing and spent 3 months of my life prototyping the living heck out of dactyl keyboard to 
 modify them for my needs until I came accross the configurator that I linked below. This tool is a life saver. Please consider 
 supporting the maintainer if you can. This tool is quite versitile and allows for a simpler way to interact with these keyboard
 builds.

## What is this?
 I used the configurator at [ryanis.cool/cosmos](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/) to create my best attempt at an Advantage360 clone.
 I used a multitude of great resources out there on how to wire and program my own keyboards but
 if you would like to see a build tutorial on this exact keyboard then I will try to make time to
 get all of the details recorded on this repo.
